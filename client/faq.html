    <h1>Questions, ey?</h1>
    <blockquote>My mother made me a scientist without ever intending to.
    Every other Jewish mother in Brooklyn would ask her child after school, "So?
    Did you learn anything today?" But not my mother. "Izzy," she would say,
    "did you ask a good question today?" That difference&mdash;asking good
    questions&mdash;made me become a scientist."

      <p>We <strong>don't</strong>; <em>you</em> do!</p>

      <p><strong>Any data</strong> you enter into the survey form <strong>will
        be made public</strong>. If you are not comfortable with sharing your
        data, do not enter it.</p>

      <p>That being said, <strong>we do not ask you for any information that
        identifies you</strong>. You don't need an email or account to use
        this site, nor do we want any of that information from you. We don't use
        cookies or other means to track visitors. Using this website involves no
        3rd-party online services, no Google Analytics, no ads, nothing (take a
        look at the <a href="https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/dmc">code</a>,
        and see for yourself).</p>

      <p>We assign two <strong>random identifiers</strong> to a new submission.
        One for you to <strong>update</strong> your submission, and another one
        to <strong>access statistics</strong> computed based upon the
        submission. You should keep the first one to yourself, and share the
        latter one with anyone and everyone you desire.</p>

      <p>Remember, we do not track people. If you lose your access URL, we have
        no way of helping you recover it. <strong>Keep it safe!</strong></p>
      </dd>

      <dt>You said all data is public. Where is it?</dt>

      <dd>Data is kept in a <a href="https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/dmc_data">Git
          repository on Github</a>. It is pushed there in batches every few days.</dd>
